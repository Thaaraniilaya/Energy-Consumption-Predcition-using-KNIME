# 🚗 Car Insurance Claim Prediction Using KNIME

A predictive analytics project developed using **KNIME Analytics Platform** to forecast the likelihood of insurance claims based on customer and vehicle profiles. This project helps insurers make informed, data-driven decisions to reduce risk and detect fraud.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The aim is to analyze customer and vehicle data to identify patterns that lead to insurance claims. Using KNIME's workflow interface, the project builds a classification model to predict whether a policyholder is likely to make a claim.
